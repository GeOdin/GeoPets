# TopoPets

This will become a website where players can browse the map and find different kind of creatures.
Because they are linked to a certain location, they are called TopoPets.

Currently, you are only able to insert a (nick)name when you start and get TopoPets by clicking on their markers.
TopoPet markers are only shown on certain zoom levels.

Hope you'll enjoy it!
